We collect data about eye coordinates, head position, and eye diameter.

Here's how the training data looks like:

In realtime, the data is used to check movement along X, Y, and Z axis. When you look at the points, multiple linear regression models are trained and deployed to accurately predict and move cursor.

Open your mouth to temporarily pause the eye tracking. Wink from left eye to click.

Here's how different shapes can be traversed just using eyes
